        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, engineer, and physicist. He is best known for his contributions to the development of alternating current (AC) electricity systems, which revolutionized how we power the world today. Born in 1856, Tesla was a visionary thinker who believed in free wireless power for all.<br>

        Tesla studied electrical engineering in Austria and later worked with Thomas Edison in the United States. However, their differing views on electricity led to the famous "War of Currents", where Tesla's AC system ultimately prevailed over Edison's DC system.<br>

        Tesla was granted over 300 patents during his lifetime. He pioneered technologies like wireless communication, X-rays, remote control, and even ideas related to radar and radio.</p>
